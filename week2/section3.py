##Exercise 5:

Consider :: the effects of additional layers in the network. What will happen
if you add another layer between the one with 512 and the final layer with 10.

**Ans**: There isn't a significant impact -- because this is relatively simple data.
For far more complex data (including color images to be classified as flowers
that you'll see in the next lesson), extra layers are often necessary.
